    <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Completing the Computer Science program and developing my ePortfolio has been a transformative experience, allowing me to refine my technical skills and clarify my professional goals. The process of building and improving the programs showcased in my ePortfolio has not only solidified my expertise but also prepared me to make significant contributions in the field of computer science.</p>

    <h2>Technical Skills and Program Improvements</h2>
    <p>Throughout the program, I gained extensive knowledge in key areas such as software engineering, data structures, algorithms, database management, and security. These skills have been instrumental in developing and refining the programs included in my ePortfolio.</p>

    <h3>Enhancing the Grocery Tracker Application</h3>
    <p>I added an SQL database to the program as well as a login screen. This shows my ability to work with SQL databases and add them to pre-existing programs. The database itself contains the various usernames and passwords. I created this database using DB Browser. </p>

    <h3>Data Structures and Algorithm Optimization</h3>
    <p>In my work on data structures and algorithms, I focused on optimizing performance and memory usage. For example, in the Grocery Tracker Application, I implemented custom data structures to efficiently manage and retrieve grocery item data. This optimization not only improved the application's performance but also demonstrated my ability to apply theoretical concepts to practical challenges.</p>

    <h3>Collaborative Projects and Communication</h3>
    <p>Working on collaborative projects throughout the program has taught me the importance of effective communication and teamwork. In a software engineering course, I played a crucial role in leading a team to develop a complex web application. My responsibilities included coordinating between team members, integrating code from different developers, and ensuring that our project met all stakeholder requirements. This experience highlighted my ability to manage both the technical and interpersonal aspects of software development.</p>

    <h2>Security Enhancements</h2>
    <p>Security is a critical aspect of software development, and I have made it a priority in my projects. In the Grocery Tracker Application, I implemented security measures such as password encryption and data validation to protect user information. These enhancements demonstrate my commitment to developing secure software solutions that safeguard user data and maintain system integrity.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The ePortfolio not only showcases the breadth of my technical skills but also reflects my ability to continuously improve and refine my work. By integrating advanced features such as database management, security, and algorithm optimization into my projects, I have demonstrated my readiness to tackle complex challenges in the tech industry. I am excited to apply these skills in a professional setting and contribute to innovative software solutions that make a meaningful impact.</p>
