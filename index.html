    <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Throughout the Computer Science program, I have been able to enhance my skills by working on various projects, such as the Weekly Pay Calculator and Grocery Tracker applications. These projects allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in practical settings, pushing the boundaries of my technical abilities and contributing to my professional growth. This self-assessment will highlight key projects that illustrate my proficiency in software development, data structures, algorithms, and security, showcasing my readiness to make impactful contributions in the field of computer science.</p>

    <h2>Weekly Pay Calculator Program</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Weekly Pay Calculator</strong> was a significant project that allowed me to transition a manual spreadsheet into a fully functional C++ program. The program calculates and stores weekly earnings based on daily hours worked and miles driven, ensuring data persistence across sessions.</p>

    <h3>Key Features and Enhancements:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Structures:</strong> I implemented a <code>std::map</code> to store weekly earnings, allowing efficient retrieval and update operations based on week labels. Arrays were used to manage daily inputs such as hours worked and miles driven.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithm Optimization:</strong> The program included robust input validation using <code>std::stringstream</code> to ensure accurate and reliable calculations. Additionally, I optimized file I/O operations to maintain data integrity across sessions.</li>
        <li><strong>Modular Design:</strong> I modularized the code by creating reusable functions like <code>getDoubleInput</code>, <code>saveEarnings</code>, and <code>loadEarnings</code>, enhancing the program's maintainability and scalability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reflections:</h3>
    <p>This project improved my understanding of data structures and algorithms in a real-world application. The use of <code>std::map</code> for storing data provided efficient access and manipulation of weekly records, while input validation ensured reliable user interactions. Future enhancements could include integrating a GUI for better user interaction and expanding the data storage capabilities to handle larger datasets using a database.</p>

    <h2>Grocery Tracker Application</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Grocery Tracker</strong> is another critical project that showcases my ability to work with databases, implement security measures, and optimize algorithms for data-driven decisions.</p>

    <h3>Key Features and Enhancements:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Low Stock Identification:</strong> I added a function to identify and list items with a stock count below a specified threshold, allowing store managers to make informed restocking decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Database Integration:</strong> I introduced an SQL database to store user credentials and manage grocery inventory data, replacing the original text file system. This not only improved data management but also enhanced security by implementing a login screen.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Implementation:</strong> The addition of a login screen with credentials stored in an SQL database demonstrates my foundational knowledge of security practices in software development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reflections:</h3>
    <p>Enhancing the Grocery Tracker application involved significant learning, particularly in integrating SQL databases with a C++ program. This project also reinforced the importance of security in software design, leading to more reliable and secure applications. Future improvements could involve expanding database functionality and refining the user interface to improve usability.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The projects included in my ePortfolio, such as the Weekly Pay Calculator and Grocery Tracker applications, reflect my growth and proficiency in key areas of computer science, including data structures, algorithms, software development, and security. These projects demonstrate my ability to apply complex concepts to solve real-world problems effectively. Moving forward, I am eager to continue refining these skills and contribute to innovative solutions in the tech industry.</p>
